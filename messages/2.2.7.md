# MarkdownEditing 2.2.7 Changelog

Your _MarkdownEditing_ plugin is updated. Enjoy new version. For any type of
feedback you can use [GitHub issues][issues].

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue in setting files that caused failure on ST2.

## New Features

* To surround an URL with '<>', select the whole URL, then press '<'.
* Support highlight with Rust.
* Enables Styling when having ">" quotes in both numbered and un-numbered lists.

## Changes

## Note

There is a known issue with Sublime Text Dev Build that causes highlight in some code blocks (notably JavaScript and JSON) not closing as intended. I recommend using stable version for now.
